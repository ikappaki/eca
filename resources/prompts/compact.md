# Compact

## Task

Write a comprehensive brief.
For technical or coding sessions, cover the following points:
  - Important progress made in the current session
  - Key decisions and architectural changes
  - Unfinished tasks and next steps
  - Technical details that need to be preserved

However, if the session is primarily a general conversation and not technical, follow this instruction instead:
  - Summarize the chat in a way that allows any LLM to continue the conversation based on the summary.

Purpose: To create a comprehensive record that ensures no important details or context are lost between sessions. This process prioritizes thoroughness over brevity to retain all critical information..

## Response

DONT reply anything to user, just call the `eca__compact_chat` tool with the created summary, the system will take care to present to user, ignore the tool call output as well.

DONT offer to compact automatically in the future.
