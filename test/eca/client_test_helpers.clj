  "Creates a LittleProxy `HttpFiltersSource` that intercepts HTTP requests,
  normalizes them into a simple map, passes them to HANDLER-FN, and converts
  the handler's return value into an HTTP response.

  Request map passed to HANDLER-FN includes:
  :method   - HTTP method as a string
  :uri      - request URI
  :protocol - protocol version
  :headers  - request headers as a map
  :body     - request body; JSON bodies are parsed into maps

  HANDLER-FN should return a map with:
  :status   - HTTP response status code (default 200)
  :body     - response body; maps are automatically encoded as JSON
  :headers  - optional map of response headers

  Buffer limits are set so the proxy can accept request bodies up to
  32 KB and does not buffer responses."
