  It also supports optional specialized keys
  `:eca.client-http/proxy-http` and `:eca.client-http/proxy-https`,
  which define proxy servers for outgoing HTTP and HTTPS requests;
  proxy credentials are used from either proxy when provided, and if
  both are present, they must be identical, otherwise an exception is
  thrown.

  Each proxy map includes:
  :host     - the proxy host
  :port     - the proxy port
  :username - optional username for proxy authentication
  :password - optional password for proxy authentication

  Returns a map suitable for passing to `hato.client-http/build-http-client`."
